# Crypto Challenge 

This project was started following BSidesDC 2017 when I was introduced to the work of Tess Schrodinger in the form of her marvelous 'Choose Your Own Crypto' adventure series. I tinkered with the challenges until BSidesCharm 2018 when i picked up another.  I decided wanted to create something to solve these adventures as quickly as possible. The idea is to take a picture of the page and have the deciphered code returned.  Of course, there is plenty more going on behind the scenes.
